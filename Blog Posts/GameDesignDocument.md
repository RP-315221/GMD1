# GMD1 - Game Design Document - Gates of Hell
This game has been inspired by a lowpoly 3D procedually generated runner called 'Quest Keeper' / 'Call of Dungeon'.

## Concept statement
The game will have a multitude of levels full of traps for the player to beat using simple movement controls and pitch perfect timing.
## Genres
'Gates of Hell' will be a mixture of an arcade styled dungeon crawler / platformer.
## Target audience
The game will target people who have patience to master the simple movement controls in order to consistently survive in the levels and wish to challenge themselves. It will not be an easy game.
## Unique selling points
Most of the games on the arcade machine previously have been 2D, this will be 3D. Moreover, its designed to be easy to get into, has very simple controls, all good features of an arcade game. 
## Player experience
The player is a small character that is able to walk in 4 directions. Their will progress through levels full of traps. They will have to collect collectibles and avoid dying from the traps.
## Visual and Audio style
The visual style of the game will retain some features from the inspiration - 3D low poly. However the overall thematic will change, once again, we are moving away from dungeon, more towards hell. It will be less creepy and dark, more warm colors, fire, lava, rock textures, hopefully some fitting props too.
## Game World Fiction
Same as the game controls, the game lore is not overly complicated. We are playing as a small demon - a goofy eyeball with arms and legs. This demon wants to escape hell and enter the human realm. 
## Platform
The game is primarily aimed to be compatible with PC using Xbox controls. However, it can very easily be converted to a mobile game too. 
## Gameplay loops
The gameplay loop of the player is to get into a level, die, restart and grind it out until they pass it.
As for the game objects, there will be traps that periodically trigger or have pathways they pass through.
## Objectives and Progression
There will be a total of 5 levels, each level will be divided into 3 sections using a pair of gates. These gates will be opened by collecting collectibles. If the player dies, they restart the whole level, if they get to the next one their respawn is set there. 
## Monetization
So far none. For the future we could add character skins, additional mechanics as DLC’s or something
## Interactivity
The player physical interactions consist of:
* Interaction with the traps – if collided with them or their projectiles, they will die.
* Interaction with the map geometry, there will be some holes in the floor that the player can fall through and die. If a player bumps into gates or a wall, they will stop moving.
* Interaction with collectibles – they need to be collected to open a gate. 
## Milestones
1. Player model + Controlls
2. Level layout + textures + props
3. Traps + Game UI
